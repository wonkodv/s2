Precision
    Project search Box based on heading and speed
    When matching Keypoints, calculate Center, and match again against keypoints in that area

Error Recovery
    keep history of points
    add confidence to point
    ignore outliers

Performance
    Get Screenshot only from Minimap Area. if black, get position from Map
    Put Debug Objects in a Queue and handle asynchronously.

    Pipeline with adjusting speed of computation:
          > A   Get screenshot
        A > B   analyze screenshot
          > C   analyze map
        B,C > D match
        D,C2 >  validate and improve match

    Put Keypoints for 64 pixel squares in bins, stored in a dict and then match
    against several bins instead of detetcing keypoints again.


Tasks:
    Move to pipeline:
        create side-effect free functions:
            [x] global config
            [x] get_image()
            [ ] get_keypoints_from_minimap(minimap_image)
            [ ] match_keypoints(minimap_keypoints, map_keypoints)
            [ ] validate_match(match_points)
            [x] get_keypoints_from_map_area()
            [ ] update_position(new_position, confidence)

        [x] Create Pipeline Manager:
            1 thread per function
            get info from Q / sleep for a while
            call function
            put result on next Q
